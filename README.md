# Census

https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic-data-Census/

Java for processing UK Human population Census data.

## Code status and development roadmap
Actively being developed and working towards a Version 1.0.0 release.
This code is fairly immature.
The current plan is to revert to generating Java code for processing the data rather than crafting this by hand.
Once 2011 and 2001 data have been parsed and are suported then this can be extended for processing earlier and perhaps later census data as they become available.

## Dependencies
Please see the pom.xml for details.
1. Data: https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic-data/. A Java library for data processing.
2. Generic: https://github.com/agdturner/agdt-java-generic. A Java library with generally useful classes and methods that have been abstracted from other libraries which now depend on this.

Unit tests are to be written using JUnit 5. So there is a dependency on that for a fully tested build.
